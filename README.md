# PunchUpConsole
A Console version of an app I am making for Android.
Feel free to start making your account and submitting your script.
WARNING: You need to enter the script path, then file name, THEN FILE EXTENSION correctly, or the console app won't work.
Example: C:\Folder\FolderPlace\This_File.txt'
Also, the Producer.txt has two users I created. Their scripts will most likely not be located because the file paths
are for my personal computer.
//Feel free or download to make your own changes.
